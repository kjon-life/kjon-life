This project is an avocational exploration of web development.  


### Project Overview:
* App code is a simple Go web server 
* The app is containerized into a Docker image called `kjon-life` 
* The Dockerfile uses a Go builder image to compile the app code and copies the binary into a minimal final image
* The app can be manually deployed using flyctl from the fly.toml config file
* GitHub Actions deploys main to dev automatically

### Tech stack:
* Go - for the app code
* Docker - for containerization
* flyctl - for manual deployment
* GitHub Actions - for CI/CD
* Fly.io - for the serverless hosting platform

```flyctl``` is a CLI tool from [Fly.io](http://fly.io)
You can read about it [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/).

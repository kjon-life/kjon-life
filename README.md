    I've been a builder üçÄ all my life making systems that work for enterprise, production loads. I am an `avocational` product manager, because enterprise "products" __are__ **the systems we build** to solve problems.  
    It's a subtle, distinct difference: Individuals buy products, enterprise buys solutions. 
    Everything we build has far-reaching effects. That nifty new feature might require re-training hundreds of employees. That data-flow optimization? Might force 600 people to change their spreadsheets. My life requires a blend of pragmatic thinking, big-picture realism, and disciplined attention to detail.
    But in this project I've gone back to the basics, revisiting the fun stuff, the front end, the building something from scratch because it interests me.

About:  
- I work in the intersections of programming, performance, and revenue.  
- I am deeply curious about data analytics, the way we present and consume information, and natural language processing. 
- I enjoy walking, buskers, cold plunging, '67-'73 Chevy trucks, and Chagaccino! 
- Currently, I'm levelling up in open source by testing, coding,  authoring tutorials, writing articles, writing (as-yet-unpublished) books, and a bit of free-lance into AI. 

### Project Overview:
* App code is a simple Go web server 
* The app is containerized into a Docker image called `kjon-life` 
* The Dockerfile uses a Go builder image to compile the app code and copies the binary into a minimal final image
* The app can be manually deployed using flyctl from the fly.toml config file
* GitHub Actions deploys main to dev automatically

### Tech stack:
* Go - for the app code
* Docker - for containerization
* flyctl - for manual deployment
* GitHub Actions - for CI/CD
* Fly.io - for the serverless hosting platform

```flyctl``` is a CLI tool from [Fly.io](http://fly.io)
You can read about it [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/).
